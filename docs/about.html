My first coding experiences were with Visual Basic. I was amazed how I created something from almost nothing and I fell in love with it. After that I started researching more and more about programming and as I was already familiar with Visual Studio IDE, I started learning C#. Somewhere in between I stumbled upon HTML and CSS. I adored how easy it was to create a website. Few lines of code and you are up. I was almost 15 and already experimented with few programming languages and I knew I wanted to do that for living. So I enrolled in high school that, in my proximity, was the most similar to something that I wanted to be. It was Computer Technician where I learned C++ and Java and also a lot of relevant stuff about computers, databases, network and even electricity. While at high school I participated in several programming competitions and I participated and won competition for the best innovative idea to prevent misuse of handicapped parking spaces. My final work for high school was android application that I made with my friend. It was an multi tool application with unit converters, calculator, timer, stopwatch.</p><p>After high school I enrolled in Department of mathematics in Osijek with programme in mathematics and computer science. While at college I started reading more and more about javascript and its frameworks. I really liked the idea of it so I started learning it little by little on my own. Few months later I started creating more and more projects and finally, I settled. No longer was I looking for what I wanted to do as a programmer. Eventually I dropped out of college and started PHP course at Algebra to get an degree which I finished after 3 months. After that I kept learning more about front-end while doing my own projects in javascript.</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/about","query":{},"buildId":"d1kEHDMH4T-WxkpewnitE","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-2f74f7d9820760171318.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/d1kEHDMH4T-WxkpewnitE/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/about" src="/_next/static/d1kEHDMH4T-WxkpewnitE/pages/about.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-c212667a5f965e81e004.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.e84fa698c7ee940652bd.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/75899aae.399f109fdec6a50191d5.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.ceeeee915f5ebe162cf6.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-fc14cdef6836eb7166b2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/d1kEHDMH4T-WxkpewnitE/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/d1kEHDMH4T-WxkpewnitE/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
