My first coding experiences were with Visual Basic. I was amazed how I created something from almost nothing and I fell in love with it. After that I started researching more and more about programming and as I was already familiar with Visual Studio IDE, I started learning C#. Somewhere in between I stumbled upon HTML and CSS. I adored how easy it was to create a website. Few lines of code and you are up. I was almost 15 and already experimented with few programming languages and I knew I wanted to do that for living. So I enrolled in high school that, in my proximity, was the most similar to something that I wanted to be. It was Computer Technician where I learned C++ and Java and also a lot of relevant stuff about computers, databases, network and even electricity. While at high school I participated in several programming competitions and I participated and won competition for the best innovative idea to prevent misuse of handicapped parking spaces. My final work for high school was android application that I made with my friend. It was an multi tool application with unit converters, calculator, timer, stopwatch.`;

While at college I started reading more and more about javascript and its frameworks. I really liked the idea of it so I started learning it little by little on my own. Few months later I started creating more and more projects and finally, I settled. No longer was I looking for what I wanted to do as a programmer. Eventually I dropped out of college and started PHP course at Algebra to get an degree which I finished after 3 months. After that I kept learning more about front-end while doing my own projects in javascript.`;
